The platform is designed to cater to the needs of cricket fans who want to engage with the game in a more interactive and engaging way. With the Metaplex, users can access a stadium where they can enjoy live matches, get live updates on scores, player information, stats like runs per over through graphs, and other relevant information in real-time. The platform also provides users with a chatbot integration feature that allows them to engage with ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI, to get personalized responses to their queries and comments.

One of the most exciting features of the Metaplex is NFT ticketing. With this feature, users can purchase digital tickets for live matches that are verified through blockchain technology. These tickets are unique and cannot be replicated, providing users with an added layer of security and authenticity. Additionally, the platform also features an NFT art gallery that displays exclusive digital artwork related to cricket that users can collect, trade, and display in their virtual galleries.

The Metaplex also features various fun elements such as live concerts and ICC Expo, which provides users with an opportunity to learn more about the sport and interact with other fans from around the world. The platform's design is also environment-friendly and boasts top-notch graphics that create an immersive and engaging experience for users.
